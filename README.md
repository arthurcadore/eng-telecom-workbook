#### How to Compile the Editable Files:

This repository uses `typst` to format all homeworks and projects. You can find more information about `typst` [here](https://github.com/typst/typst). 

But, if you want to recompile or edit the files, you can simply do it by running the `.devcontainer` specifications.
